# ðŸ§  Sentiment Analyzer â€“ Clean Architecture with OpenAI API

A modular and extensible sentiment analysis system built with **Python**, designed under **SOLID principles** and leveraging the **OpenAI API** for natural language understanding.

This project demonstrates professional-grade architecture, dependency injection, configuration validation with **Pydantic**, and a robust testing approach â€” all structured for scalability and maintainability.

---

## Key Features

- **Clean Architecture:** Clear separation between configuration, logic, and testing layers.
- **SOLID Principles:** Ensures extensibility and easy maintenance.
- **Dependency Injection:** Reduces coupling and promotes testability.
- **Config Validation:** Uses `Pydantic` for secure and structured environment management.
- **Error Handling:** Implements layered exception management for stability.
- **Unit Testing:** Includes tests to ensure consistency and reliability.
- **OpenAI Integration:** Abstracted GPT-powered sentiment analysis.

# Design Highlights
Principle	Application
Single Responsibility	Each module handles one concern (config, logic, tests).
Open/Closed	Easily extendable to support new models or providers.
Dependency Inversion	Abstracts external APIs via interface-style design.
Validation Layer	Pydantic ensures consistent and secure configuration.
Error Abstraction	Clear exception hierarchy for debugging and observability.
